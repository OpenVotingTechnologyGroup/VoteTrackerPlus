"""How to manage a VTP specific contest"""

class Contest:
    """
    A class to handle the rules of engagement regarding a specific
    contest.  A contest is a dict.

    Some historical design notes.  A ballot originally had contests
    being a funky dict in version 0.1.0. However, in version 0.2.0
    contests was changed to an ordered list, greatly simplifying some
    low level logic.  The git log entry in 0.1.0 also ended up having
    an analogous dictionary with an outer "CVR" key.  This has also
    become OBE and so in 0.2.0 the git log entry is now just a simple
    one level dictionary.

    At the same time in an effort to simplify things, the contest
    selection logic was moved from the Ballot class to this class
    while changing the Ballot class to _always_ create Contest objects
    when it encounters a contest.

    Note - the contest is a dict with the following set-able keys:
    - choices: a list of choices, each choice is either a string or a dict
      with the keys 'name' and optionally 'party' and 'ticket_names'
    - tally: the tally type, either 'plurality' or 'rcv'
    - win_by: currently defunct (was setable).  Support for setting this can
      re-appear when support for simple contests with non simple majority (say
      2/3 majority) winners are supported.  So for plurality it is ignored.  For
      RCV it is set dynamically per open_position round as a function of open_positions.
    - max_selections: the maximum number of selections a voter may select.  Defaults
      to 1 for plurality and the number of choices for RCV.
    - open_positions: number of open positions.  Defaults to 1 for both plurality and RCV.
      This is basically the number of open seats.  When tally=RCV and open_positions=1,
      RCV more or less becomes STV.
    - write_in: a boolean indicating if write-in votes are allowed, defaults to False
    - description: a optional string describing the contest
    - contest_type: the type of contest, either 'candidate', 'ticket', or 'question'
    - ticket_titles: a list of titles for the tickets, only used in ticket contests
    - election_upstream_remote: a string indicating the upstream remote for the election,
      used for voter UX
    - contest_name: a string indicating the name of the contest
    - ggo: a string indicating the GGO (General Governmental Organization) for the contest

    The contest also has the following keys that are not part of the
    contest dict but are used for internal tracking and management:
    - uid: a unique identifier for the contest, automatically generated.
    - selection: a list of selections made by the voter, can be empty.
    - cast_branch: a string indicating the branch of the cast vote, used for tracking.
    - name: a string indicating the name of the contest.
