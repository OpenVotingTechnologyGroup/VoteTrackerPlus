# VOTES

A Verifiable Open Technology Election System

# Overview

VOTES is a distributed, open-source [voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting) system that creates transparent, secure, and accurate elections with individual verifiability.

**BUSINESS ADVANTAGES:**  VOTES can be adopted by existing election solution providers ([ESS/Diebold](http://www.essvote.com/about/), [ClearBallot](http://www.clearballot.com/), etc.), public or private agencies during the [RFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal) process for voting machines, or anyone wishing to provide election systems/solutions.  VOTES is both a self-contained free open-source platform as well as a revenue generating [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) solution capable of handling national, state, town, or private elections.

**TECH ADVANTAGES:** VOTES allows the voter to anonymously validate their ballot and its accurate inclusion in an election while likewise allowing election officials to do the same for all ballots.  It is extremely immune to hacking and compromise due to its distributed, bitcoin-like hashed full ledger design.

**END-VOTER ADVANTAGES:**  Using VOTES the voter can validate their ballot as well as validating the tally of any or all contests. VOTES is 100% transparent, insuring that no entity or person can mishandle or manipulate any vote or contest. 

**VOTER RIGHTS/POLICY ADVANTAGES:**   VOTES is not a voter ID system, but by supporting the surgical and tracked nullification of specific ballots during a recount, the natural tension between extensive voter pre identification/registration and a low effective barrier to voting, particularly for the disenfranchised and disadvantaged, is mitigated.  Under due process a ballot can be nullified after the fact as well as un-nullified with full automatic disclosure.

VOTES is intended to be as compliant as possible with [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology)'s [voting](https://www.nist.gov/itl/voting) efforts (see the [HAVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act) Act).

# Basic Design Goal

The basic high level design goals are:

* The voter can validate the accuracy of their vote and its proper tally at any time
* After all polls close, anyone with access to the election repository can count the votes
* There is both a paper and electronic trail with the necessary security attributes
* The system:
  * can support any vote counting [methodology](https://electology.org/library)
  * is incrementally adoptable at different geographical/geopolitical overlays/levels
  * scales well, is secure, and ensures election accuracy and transparency
  * easily testable - simulations can be run at will
* Create a solution that is usable in the 2020 US election

# Status - 2017/03/20

VOTES is currently in the design phase - still working out the basics.
* Looking for volunteers to help layout basic business plans and technical designs
* See the [docs](https://github.com/PacemTerra/votes/tree/master/docs) directory for more information
* There is also a [wiki](https://github.com/PacemTerra/votes/wiki) (currently contains more or less the same information worded differently)
* There is a [votes-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/votes-dev) Google Group for public discussion.  Email me at windoverwater at gmail dot com for more private communication.
