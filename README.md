# VOTES

A Verifiable Open Technology Election System

# Overview

__Elevator Pitch:__  VOTES is a distributed, open-source solution that creates transparent, secure, and accurate elections.  It is an [election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election) / [voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting) cloud based system that allows the voter to validate their ballot and its accurate inclusion in the tally of an election while likewise allowing election officials to validate each ballot and each tally.

The basic idea is to design a open technology system for elections that can either be adopted by existing election system providers ([ESS/Diebold](http://www.essvote.com/about/), [ClearBallot](http://www.clearballot.com/), etc.), by public or private agencies during the [RFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal) process, or by anyone wishing to provide election systems - i.e. a public agency, an individual, or a high tech start-up.  VOTES is both a self-contained open-source platform as well as a [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) offering.

VOTES is intended to be as compliant as possible with [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology)'s [voting](https://www.nist.gov/itl/voting) efforts (see the [HAVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act) Act).

# Basic Design Goal

The basic high level design goals are:

* The voter can validate the accuracy of their vote and its proper tally at any time
* After all polls close, anyone with access to the election repository can count the votes
* There is both a paper and electronic trail with the necessary security attributes
* The system:
  * can support any vote counting [methodology](https://electology.org/library)
  * is incrementally adoptable at different geographical/geopolitical overlays/levels
  * scales well, is secure, and ensures election accuracy and transparency
  * easily testable - simulations can be run at will
* Create a solution that is usable in the 2020 US election

# Status - 2017/03/20

VOTES is currently in the design phase - still working out the basics.
* Looking for volunteers to help layout basic business plans and technical designs
* See the [docs](https://github.com/PacemTerra/votes/tree/master/docs) directory for more information
* There is also a [wiki](https://github.com/PacemTerra/votes/wiki) (currently contains more or less the same information worded differently)
* There is a [votes-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/votes-dev) Google Group for public discussion.  Email me at windoverwater at gmail dot com for more private communication.
