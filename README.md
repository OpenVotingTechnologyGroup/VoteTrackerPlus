# VOTES

A Verifiable Open Technology Election System

# Overview

VOTES is a distributed, open-source [voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting) system that enables transparent, secure, and accurate elections with full voter based [End-to-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_auditable_voting_systems) verifiable (E2EV) ballots.  VOTES maximizes the transparency and trust of an election throughout the election process by:

- allowing each voter to verify that their ballot is electronically cast, collected, and counted as intended
- allowing each voter and all election officials to verify the tally of all the ballot questions
- allowing each voter to inspect their neighborhood for fraudulent voters and/or addresses
- allowing each voter and all election officials to inspect all the voter names and addresses across the entire electorate for possible voter and ballot fraud
- cryptographically associating the anonymous paper ballots with the anonymous VOTERS digital copies, insuring that neither set is tampered or fraudulently altered as well as supplying a third copy directly to the voter themselves, thus creating 3 separate copies of the anonymous but cryptographically signed ballot data

VOTES is an open source distributed database/repository and application that supports

- full End-to-End validation (E2EV) of the paper and digital ballots
- storing all the electronically interpreted scans of the paper ballots in a secure and anonymous manner
- executing the tally of all the races via 100% open source software contained within the same repositories as the ballot data
- creating blank ballots as a function of address
- storing the address and name of all the voters who cast a ballot without the association of any other information - the ballots are 100% anonymous

VOTES is NOT a:

- voter ID solution
- voter registration solution
- ballot scanner nor contains ballot scanning software - VOTES receives the interpreted ballot from the ballot scanner, which could be a traditional mechanical scanner, smart phone application, or manually from an election official
- replacement for paper ballots - VOTES requires the balloting process to start and end with a paper ballot

For a more detailed overview, see the file [./kickstarter/project-story.md](./kickstarter/project-story.md) in this git repo.

VOTES is intended to be compliant to the extent that it makes sense with [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology)'s [voting](https://www.nist.gov/itl/voting) efforts (see the [HAVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act) Act).

VOTES will attempt to leverage as much code and prior art from such projects as [VotingWorks](https://voting.works/).

The following is a short and incomplete list of other and past voting projects:
* [Helios Voting](https://heliosvoting.org/) 
* [Scantegrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scantegrity)

# Status - 2021/02/21

VOTES is currently in the design phase - still working out the basics and trying to obtain credible peer reviews.  The current priorities are:
* Looking for technical, legal, and UX design peer reviews
* Looking for volunteers to help in any way
* Working on a kickstarter/gofundme campaign
* Looking into potential funding
