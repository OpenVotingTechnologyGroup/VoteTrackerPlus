1) What is VOTES?

VOTES, an acronym for Verifiable Open Technology Election System, is a distributed, full-ledger, open-source voting system that creates 100% transparent, secure, and verifiable elections.  VOTES creates both a physical paper ballot at the voting center as well as an electronic copy.  The electronic copy is stored in a full-ledger, bitcoin-like, digitally signed repository which is publicly available after all the polls close.  This public repostory contains all the blank and cast ballots as well as the tally algorithms of how to count each contest on every ballot.  Once available, every citizen can download a copy of the ledger and perform the tally of the votes for any contest.  And if a voter has obtained a copy of their ballot's public key, they can use that public key to inspect their specific ballot.

2) More technical information on VOTES

VOTES is part an election framework and part an implementation of the necessary digital solutions needed to run an open, transparent, and secure digital based election.  The two major aspects are 1) two publicly available repositories, one containing a full ledger accounting of the election available post all the polls close, and one containing the voter's name and address; and 2) a SaaS solution for actually running an election.

VOTES is open source with the initial release being hosted on github employing the Git software development application as an initial technology prototype.  Those with a greater interest in the technology can visit the github project at https://github.com/relengcom/votes.

3) What is the kickstarter funding?

The kickstarter project has two important goals.  One is to raise the funds to win one or more state or city RFPs (Request For Proposals) to implement a transparent, open-source, verifiable election system.

Another goal of the kickstarter program is raise awareness for open source, full ledger based  election systems.  Even if our funding goal is not reached, the kickstarter campaign will be successful if VOTES is thoroughly reviewed by end voters, election scientists, and technology experts.  Being open source, such a review can be critically important for any next generation digital election solution and serve as an important open source reference.

See the kickstarter funding goals in the github project for more details.

3) How does an end voter interact with VOTES?

For casting votes at a physical voting center, there are only a few subtle changes that the end voter will experience.  When they submit their paper ballot to the VOTES ballot scanner, their ballot has the possibility of being rejected in their presence if any portion of it cannot be successfully scanned.  If so, they can privately address the issue.

When successfully scanned, the voter has the option of privately obtaining a copy of their ballot's public key.  Once all the polls close, the public key can be used to inspect their specific electronic copy of their ballot.

Also, once all the polls close any voter can download a copy of the full ledger public repository and count the votes themselves.  All tallies of all contests are publicly executable.  There is no third party, human or machine, that secretly counts the votes.  This is particularly important as communities and states adopt Rank Choice Voting - maximizing transparency and trust in a RCV tally is important during the process of its adoption as well as during the actual election.  And there is no better way to maximize that trust then by allowing all voters to inspect all the code and all the data as well as execute the RCV tally on their own device.

4) How does an election official interact with VOTES?

Pre-election day, VOTES supplies the framework in which all the geographical/geopolitical overlays (GGO's), such as states, counties, municipalities, cities, towns, districts, precincts, school districts, etc., can easily compose the ballots for their specific constituents, based on address or other criteria, in an iterative, collaborative, and independent manner.

During election day, VOTES can generate address-specific ballots, scan cast ballots, and help end voters correct un-scannable ballots.  The VOTES SaaS solution runs the digital portion of the election while the ballots are added to the public repository.

5) End to End Validation (E2EV)

VOTES directly supports E2EV by providing a consistent but customizable framework for every participating voting center.  The physical ballots can be independently sampled and compared to the electronic copies without decoding any of the encrypted data.  

6) Gerrymandering

VOTES does not solve or directly address gerrymandering.  However, it does include the Monte Carlo simulations necessary to display the deviation if any of the current districting per GGO (geographical/geopolitical overlay, as in, a state, county, school, etc., districting), from the ideal average for that GGO.  Since VOTES does this both at the GGO level and at the address and ballot level, every voter can directly see the effects of districting on their ballot or for their address.   By revealing directly to the voter the gerrymandering effect, if any, the goal is to ultimately reduce gerrymandering to attain the goal of one person, one vote.

7) What does VOTES offer?  What is unique about VOTES?

TRANSPARENCY: with VOTES each anonymous electronic copy of each specific ballot is directly inspectable via its public key.  All voters have the capability to privately obtain their public key for their ballot from election officials to inspect their personal ballot, either physical or electronic.  Since all public keys are available to everyone, public keys have no inherent value.  Specifically, VOTES does not create an opportunity or market in which to sell votes.

In addition all citizens can execute the tally themselves when they clone the public repository.  In this manner the tally is never executed in private by a third party, human or machine.  By bringing the ballots and the tally to the people, the trust in the election system is increased substantially compared to any closed system.

DATA SECURITY:  VOTES is a signed full ledger based solution similar but different than bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Each change to the application and/or the data is carried forward such that history cannot be changed.  The association of the paper ballot to the electronic copy is encrypted such that if the paper ballots are compromised, multiple and separate private keys are still required to decode the association of a paper ballot with the electronic copy and or the voter id.  Note that the electronic copy does not contain this information so if the electronic copy is comprised, no such association can be derived.

PROVIDES THE NECESSARY BUT MINIMAL PUBLIC DATA:  VOTES is not a voter id system or solution.  However, the VOTES public repository does include the names and addresses of the voters who cast ballots but does not contain any data that can be used to correlate the two.  By providing the names and addresses only and without correlation data, VOTES allows increased inspection and thus trust in elections without revealing additional private information.

OPERATIONAL SECURITY: When an election is being held, which includes pre-election workflows by election officials, election day workflows including entering ballots cast at polling centers, and post all the polls closed workflows, all network communication is based on best-in-class encrypted mutual-ssl communication with 2FA (2 factor authentication) interaction points and anti-bot interegation points.  The design of the VOTES repositories is distributed and naturally supports network interruptions and outages.  Private keys concerning ballot information are double encrypted via independent certificate authorities.  Each voting center operates in an independent manner, checkpointing electronic ballot activity back to the VOTES SaaS servers as opposed to constant live synchronization.
