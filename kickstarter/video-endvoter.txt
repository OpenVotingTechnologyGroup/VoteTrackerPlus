VOTES - A Verifiable Open Technology Election System

Ever been intrigued by a conspiracy theory?  They can be a lot of fun and involve a lot of creativity.  And the creativity can be very entertaining. 

But not _everything_ is better with conspiracy theories.  Attackers can disrupt democratic events and civic discourse by creating conspiracy theories and fake news that disrupts instead of entertains.  Conspiracy theories and fake news can cause regular people to distrust their fellow citizens, their own government, confusing lies with reality, confusing produced entertainment and marketing with real news.

Some things need to have strong natural immunity to both fake news and conspiracy theories.  Some things need to be so transparent, distributed, and open source that they are inherently secure both in reality and in non-reality.

Public elections should be just that - public elections should be inherently transparent and open.  The entire balloting and tally process should be transparent.  They need to be inherently trustable both in design and execution.  A democratic republic requires a few basic first principles, and one of them is fair and accurate elections.

So, ever wonder what actually, truly, happens to your ballot when you vote?  Did it really get counted correctly?  What about other ballots - where did they come from?  Did anyone vote multiple times?  Are claims of ballot fraud fake news or real news?  Regardless of how trustworthy, patriotic, and hardworking your election officials are, what happens when an election is attacked by fake news, trolls, and real spies?

Enter VOTES, a Voting Open Technology Election System.

With VOTES, you the voter can verify that your specific ballot was scanned correctly and counted correctly.  With VOTES you the voter can actually perform the same exact tally of the ballots as election officials, regardless if the tally is a simple plurality or a rank choice voting tally.  And with VOTES, you can inspect your specific electronic ballot, the one that is used in the actual tally as well as perform the tally yourself.

With VOTES every electronic copy of a ballot is directly and cryptographically connected to its original physical paper ballot and stored in a full-history ledger that is publicly available once all the poles close.  Both the paper and the electonic ballots are cryptographically signed with the same cryptographic signature, or key.  This key is similar to ones used in other cryptographic applications such as block-chain cryptocurrencies.

However, there are two critically important aspects of this cryptographic signature:

First, this cryptographic signature is a public key and not a private key - there are no private keys in VOTES.  This is vastly different than cryptocurrencies where private ownership is a must.  With public elections private ownership of a ballot is critical not to have as that would allow someone to sell their ballot.  With VOTES and the absense of private keys, there is no way to trace a public key back to a VOTER.

Second, the public key is privately given only to the voter and in a manner such that no third party can validate who owns any public key.  There is no way to prove that a specific public key belongs to a specific voter.  Even the voter herself who has the key cannot do this.

Another significant aspect of the VOTES ballot full-history ledger is that it also contains the blank ballots used by the voter as well as all the geographical/geopolitical data that comprise all the voting district boundaries used for all the contests.  VOTES contains a copy of the geographical boundaries of all the towns, school disctricts, counties, municipalities, states, etc. such that VOTES can accurately generate the correct blank ballot for any and all addresses.  Repeatably and on demand.

When an election uses VOTES, all the current methods of traditional voting is supported:  early ballots, absentee ballots, physically voting in a voting center, and vote-by-mail.  

In addition to the public ballot ledger just described, VOTES also contains a completely separate and second full ledger of all the voters and their addresses also available once all the poles close.  This second ledger contains an aggregate copy of all the voter's names and addresses that have participated in the election, but contains no other data, information, or associations.  This second ledger helps election officials to determine if a person is voting multipled times via different addresses while maximizing voter anonymity and data privacy, both during and after the election.  It allows every voter to see who else has voted on their street, in their neighborhood and beyond, maximizing the ability for the citizens themselves to spot false addresses and false people.

VOTES - transparency and open source to the people.

All this openness and transparency makes VOTES inherently immune to fake news, trolls, and conspiracy theories.  So, when election day is over, the VOTES public ledgers can be downloaded by every voter and election official alike and inspected.  And everyone can perform the tally of the votes cast.  There is no need to wait for some nebulous third party to count the votes.

And for those voters who have privately received their public key, they can use that key to look up their specific ballot.  Every such voter can confirm that their ballot has been correclty scanned and counted.

And what about the evil actors and the trolls and the conspiracy theories?  Well, with full and complete transparency, there are no dark places, no shadows, for conspiracy theories to stick.  Sure those who wish to overturn a democracy will try to cast conspiracy theories and fake news at VOTES.  But VOTES is inherently trustworthy and transparent, both in design and execution, which is much better than any other system to date.
