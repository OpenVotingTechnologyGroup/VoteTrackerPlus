VOTES - A Verifiable Open Technology Election System

A hand writing the above as a voice reads it in silence.  Very slight pause.  Then a meditation cymbal ding.  Then in reverse etch-a-sketch mode with a sound effect reveals a paper ballot (maybe blinking or something).  Which then blinks.

Video notes:  to speed things up, instead of drawing everything, use some reverse etch-a-sketch pull tabs.  Part way through have a few mistaken ones - as in, pull the tab, see something funny but relevant, and the tab is replaced.

Animation is also allowed, or at least a slight emoji like movement, if affordable.

Ever been intrigued by a conspiracy theory?  They can be a lot of fun and can involve a lot of creativity.  And the creativity can be very entertaining. 

vvvvvvvv
A few funny drawings of classic conspiracy theories - the earth is (still) flat (drawn), landing on the moon never happend (flipped); Area 51 contains flying saucers and alian lizard parts.  Instead of drawing, pull up a clear plastic sheet, with sound, and as it pulls up photoshop in a some pre-drawn conspiracy scenes; 
^^^^^^^^

But not _everything_ is better with conspiracy theories.  Take fake news or digital warfare.  Evil people can disrupt democracies and civic discourse by creating conspiracy theories and fake news that disrupts instead of merely entertaining.  Conspiracy theories can cause regular people to distrust their fellow citizens, their own government, confusing lies with reality, confusing entertainment with real news.  Just like George Orwellâ€™s 1984.  Conspiracy theories are a common weapon in this post internet age of digital warfare.

Evil avatars/actors typing at computers labeled with different conspiracy theories shoot strings of 'bytes' (0's and 1') at the Capital Building (maybe with columns labeled with democratic words), breaking pieces off of them.  Animation reveals cracks.
^^^^^^^^

Some things need to have strong natural immunity to both fake news and conspiracy theories.  Some things need to be so transparent, so distributed, so open source, that they are inherently secure both in reality and in the non-reality of fake news.

Public elections should be just that - public elections should be inherently transparent and open source.  They need to be inherently trustable both in design and the execution there of.  A democratic republic requires a few basic first principles, and one of them is fair and accurate elections.  Elections need to be trust worthy and naturally immune to digitial warfare, fake news, and conspiracy theories.

Maybe there is a 'V' in the center of the shield and a subtle reference somewhere else of an O'Keeffe 'V'.

So, ever wonder what actually, truly, happens to your ballot when you vote?  Did it really get counted correctly?  What about other ballots - where did they come from?  Did anyone vote multiple times?  Are claims of ballot fraud fake news or real news?  Regardless of how trustworthy, patriotic, and hardworking your election officials are, what happens when an election is attacked by fake news and trolls?

vvvvvvvv
An animation - a spong bob like ballot stands in line, gets its picture taken, the picture is sent to a black box that counts the ballot incrementing a count of one of two candidate names.  Then there are many such black boxes, all incrementing counts.  When done, those counts get photographed and sent to another block box.  All the black boxes say Acme Corporation, company confidential.

Enter VOTES, a Voting Open Technology Election System.

With VOTES, you the voter can verify not only your ballot was scanned correctly, but that it and all the ballots were correctly counted.  With VOTES you the voter can actually perform the same exact tally of the votes as election officials, regardless if the tally is a simple plurality tally or a rank choice voting tally with 20 candidates.  The tally can be performed on any laptop or computer.

That's right - every voter can inspect the electonic copy of their specific ballot.  And like double entry accounting ledgers where accountants enter every number twice so to best catch errors, with VOTES there is a 100% physical paper ballot and an independent but linked electronic copy, supporting this 1,000 year old accounting best practice.

With VOTES every electronic ballot is directly connected to each specific paper ballot.  And each electronic copy is cryptographically signed with both the ballot and the previous ballot's cryptographic signature, similar to cryptocurrency block-chain techniques.  And each ballot chain from each independent voting center in the same manner is cryptographically aggregated with the other ballot chains.

Unlike bitcoin and other block-chain solutions, with VOTES there is no private key that can be used to identify a ballot with an end voter.  There are no private keys that can be sold to the highest bidder or used to buy and sell votes, creating a market to directly buy an election.  With VOTES there is only public keys.

Once the polls close, the final, aggregated pile of ballots is made available for download by everyone.

An animation - a spong bob like ballot stands in line, it gets a digest from the previous ballot in line, a picture is taken and the ballot is stamped with a new digest which is also attached to the the photograph and handed to the next ballot in line.  The photographs are handcuffed together and are folded flat into a pile.  There are many such transparent boxes.  Each folded pile is in a similar manner stamped and linked together into one large, inseparable pile.

Then the pile is shown being downloaded by several end voters who push the count-me button on the computer screen, and all the voters get the same count/winner.
^^^^^^^^

When an election uses VOTES, all the current methods of traditional voting is supported:  early ballots, absentee ballots, physically voting in a voting center, and by vote-by-mail.

There are a three important aspects to VOTES.

The first aspect is that your ballot's public key is only privately shown to you in a manner where no one else can confirm or deny that the public key is indeed yours.  These privately shared but public keys have no market worth - they cannot be bought or sold - and they cannot be used to identify the owner of the ballot.

^^^^^^^^

The second is that VOTES cryptographically stores all the ballots in a sealed full-history ledger.  This technology has some important similarities to traditional block chain technologies used by cryptocurrencies.  This full ledger includes not just all scanned ballots, but also all the software used to count the ballots.  The ledger also contains the blank ballots as well as all the geopolitical geographical overlay information - the state, county, and municipal election boundaries - so to be able to generate blank ballots.

Every change, whether it is to the blank ballot, a districting boundary, as well as the cast ballots is cryptographically sealed, in the full history public ledger.  The full ledger captures the history of the entire election in a mathicatically immutable form, including the specific tally algorithms and ballots.

^^^^^^^^

The third important aspect to VOTES is that it contains a second, private, and separate full ledger of all the voters and their addresses.  This second ledger is owned by the officials running the election and is secured and private.  It contains an aggregate copy of all the voter's names and addresses that have participated in the election and most importantly, it contains no other information, data, or associations.  This secured and private aggregated data helps election officials to determine if a person is voting multipled times via different addresses while maximizing voter anonymity and data privacy, both during and after the election.  Though private it helps election officials repel the conspiracy theories that people travel to different states to vote multiple times.

^^^^^^^^

All this openness and transparency makes VOTES inherently immune to fake news, trolls, and digital warfare techniques.  So, when election day is over, the VOTES public ledger can be downloaded by every voter and election official and the tally executed.  No need to wait for some nebulous third party to count the votes.  The private VOTES ledger remains private allowing additional post-election day analysis.

And for those voters who have privately received their public key, they can use that key to look up their specific ballot.  Every such voter can confirm that their ballot has been scanned and counted correctly.

And as more and more states adopt rank choice voting to break the negative affects of a two party political system, being able to personally tally rank choice voting elections adds yet more transparency.

Total transparency.  All the source code, all the geopolitical geographical overlay data, all the blank ballots, and all the cast ballots available to all.

vvvvvvvv
Show a voter at their computer downloading the election once the polls close and tallying the votes.  And then listening to the news report the same result.  And then inspecting their individual ballot.
^^^^^^^^

And what about the evil actors and the trolls and the conspiracy theories?  Well, with full and complete transparency, there are no dark places, no shadows, for conspiracy theories to stick.  Sure those who wish to overturn a democracy will try to cast conspiracy theories at VOTES.  And evil actors will use the most potent forms of digital warefare to disrupt the actual execution of the election.  But VOTES is inherently trustworthy and transparent, both in design and execution, which is much better than any other system to date.
