VOTES - a verifiable open technology election system - increases the security, accuracy, and trustworthiness of a paper ballot election by:
- giving cryptographically anonymized ballot receipts back to the voter
- providing each voter full access to all the data and software
- allowing each voter to execute the tally and inspect the voter rolls
