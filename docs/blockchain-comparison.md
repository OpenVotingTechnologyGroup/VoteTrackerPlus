### 3) How does VTP compare with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology? What is similar; what is different; and why does VTP “rock” as a ballot tracking solution while cryptocurrency blockchains do not?

Cryptocurrency blockchains are an ideal solution for managing a public ledger of financial transactions where there is a strong goal to not have a single entity third-party adjudicate the transactions. The public ledger aspect of cryptocurrencies secures the entire history of all transactions forever, thus providing the adjudication of transactions.  The same is true for the VTP public ledger - it secures the CVR's of all the ballots. However, where cryptocurrency blockchains need to secure the ownership of a transaction with private keys, in public elections securing the ownership of a ballot must be impossible - whether it is an explicit law or not, ballots must be anonymous from start to finish. Therefore, VTP has no private keys while the public keys (public digests) and the public ledger remain.

Cryptocurrencies also require a distributed ledger so that no one entity needs to be trusted with securing the ledger. However, in the case of a public election, by law, election officials must directly manage the ledger, while the public wants (and should be able) to independently validate the ledger after all the polls close as correct and without loss of trustworthiness or security.  With VTP, the anonymized physical (paper) ballot receipt that each voter receives contains a small batch of public keys for a corresponding small batch of cast ballots, one of which is the voter's. Although the VTP public ledger is not distributed, and in fact, is effectively owned by the single legal entity administering the election, the fact that the voter has a small batch of transactions that each insures the history of all previous transactions, empowers every voter to independently validate the single-sourced public ledger.

So, without private keys and the need to mutually validate transactions across a set of independent coin miners as with cryptocurrency blockchains, the need for proof-of-work or proof-of-stake is removed, reducing a bunch of complexity and since we’re very energy, climate and environmentally conscious here, that also means saving electricity.

### Why Support VoteTrackerPlus ?

VoteTracker+ or VTP will be the best available public technology for verifying paper-ballot-based election results while being aligned with the most important aspects of securing, stabilizing, and defending a democratic polity.

Trustworthy elections are the foundation of democracy. Nothing has highlighted the urgency for a service like VoteTracker+ more than the 2020 election and the January 6th attack on the Capitol. As it stands today, American voters (approaching 70%) do not trust the election process.

Nearly everything voters interact with in the election process is based on outdated black-box technology, and there is no way to independently verify that their ballot selections were accurately recorded and counted, or that their votes were secured from tampering from bad actors. American voters deserve a best-in-class ballot tracking and verification system that adheres to what elections professionals refer to as the “VAST mandate.” An election is said to be worthy of trust (i.e., trustworthy) if, and only if the election and the technology used for that election is:

- Verifiable
- Accurate
- Secure
- Transparent
