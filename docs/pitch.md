VOTES is a Verifiable Open Technology Election System that increases the security, accuracy, and trustworthiness of a paper ballot election by:

- giving a cryptographically anonymized and secured ballot receipt back to the voter

- allowing each voter to execute the official tally, anonymously inspect their ballot, and to inspect the public voter ID rolls

- cryptographically recording the history of the election as it occurs in real time, prior to, during, and after election day
