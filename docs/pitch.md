VOTES is a Verifiable Open Technology Election System that increases the security, accuracy, and trustworthiness of a paper ballot election by:

1) giving a cryptographically anonymized and secured ballot receipt back to the voter

2) allowing each voter to execute the official tally, anonymously inspect their ballot, and to inspect the public voter ID rolls

3) cryptographically recording the history of the election as it occurs in real time and distributing that data back to both the election officials and the voters

With three effectively separate copies of the data, VOTES provides a never before realized compelling and transparent level of election accuracy and trustworthiness.
