VOTES is a Verifiable Open Technology Election System that increases the security, accuracy, and trustworthiness of a paper ballot election by:

1) giving a cryptographically anonymized and secured ballot receipt back to the voter

2) allowing each voter to execute the official tally, anonymously inspect their ballot in the tally, and to inspect the public voter ID rolls

3) cryptographically recording the history of the election as it occurs in real time and distributing that data to election officials and to the voters, effectively creating three separate copies

With three separate copies of the cryptographically secured ballots, VOTES provides a never before realized compelling and transparent level of election accuracy and trustworthiness.
