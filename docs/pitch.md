VoteTracker+ is an open software ballot tracking system that increases the security, accuracy, and trustworthiness of a paper ballot election by cryptographically tracking the paper ballots.

VoteTracker+:

- directly supplies a cryptographically anonymized ballot receipt back to the voter, allowing the voter to validate that their specific ballot has been interpreted, recorded, and tallied as intended

- cryptographically records and seals the entire history of the election as it occurs in real time

- allows the public to inspect and validate the official Cast Vote Records and tally as well as the aggregate voter ID rolls across the entire electorate
