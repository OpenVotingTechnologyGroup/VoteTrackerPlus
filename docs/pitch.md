## The Pitch

VoteTrackerPlus (VTP) is a 100% open source project that offers a verifiable guarantee directly to the voter that their ballot is correctly cast and tallied as intended. VTP provides three core capabilities that increase the security, accuracy, and trustworthiness of elections:

1. Provides a cryptographically anonymized ballot receipt back to the voter, allowing the voter to validate that their ballot has correctly cast and tallied - a.k.a. End-to-End Verification ([E2EV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_auditable_voting_systems))

2. Cryptographically records and seals the complete history of the election, pre and post election day

3. Allows the public to inspect and validate the contest tallies as well as potentially, via optional future extensions, the aggregate voter ID rolls across the entire electorate

VTP is designed fundamentally as both a plugin to existing election equipment and as a standalone election solution.  In either scenario VTP is capable of supporting and securing most if not all public election workflows, including in-person, mail-in, absentee, and early voting paper based scenarios.  In addition, VTP handles internet based voting when there are no paper ballots, directly supporting military personal and other scenarios where paper ballots are not possible or desired.
