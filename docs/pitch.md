## The Pitch

VoteTrackerPlus (VTP) is a 100% open source project that offers a verifiable guarantee directly to the voter that their ballot is correctly cast and tallied as intended. VTP provides three novel and unique core capabilities that increase the security, accuracy, and trustworthiness of elections:

1. Provides a cryptographically sealed, anonymized, and yet unencrypted ballot receipt back to the voter, allowing the voter to validate that their ballot has correctly cast and tallied - a.k.a. zero trust End-to-End Verification ([E2EV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_auditable_voting_systems))

2. Cryptographically records and seals the complete history of the election, pre and post election day

3. Allows the public to inspect and validate the contest tallies as well as potentially, via optional future extensions, the aggregate voter ID rolls across the entire VTP participating electorate and previous elections

VTP is designed fundamentally as both a plugin to existing election equipment and as a standalone election solution.  As a plugin VTP can be incorporated immediately into existing certified paper based election equipment avoiding the upfront certification process.  Regarding internet based voting solutions, either as a complete standalone election solution or as a plugin, VTP can be rolled out today to create a 100% closed loop  end-voter based E2EV solution, securing internet voting without relying on encrypted data at rest solutions.

In summary, VoteTrackerPlus can handle in-person, mail-in, absentee, early voting, and pure internet based voting, all with or without paper based ballots, either as a third party plugin or as an independent solution.
