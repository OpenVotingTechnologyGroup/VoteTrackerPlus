## The Pitch

VoteTrackerPlus is a 100% open source plugin that offers a verifiable guarantee directly to the voter that their ballot is correctly cast and tallied as intended.  Via this verifiable guarantee, VoteTracker+ provides three core capabilities that increase the security, accuracy, and trustworthiness of elections:

1. Directly supplies a cryptographically anonymized ballot check back to the voter, allowing the voter to validate that their specific ballot has correctly cast and tallied - a.k.a. End-to-End Verification ([E2EV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_auditable_voting_systems))

2. Cryptographically records and seals the complete history of the election, pre and post election day

3. Allows the public to inspect and validate the official Cast Vote Records and tally as well as potentially, via optional future extensions, the aggregate voter ID rolls across the entire electorate

VoteTrackerPlus is designed fundamentally as both a plugin to existing election equipment and as well as a standalone  election product.  In either scenario VoteTrackerPlus is capable of supporting and securing most if not all public election workflows, including in-person, mail-in, absentee, and early voting paper based scenarios.  In addition, VoteTrackerPlus directly handles internet based voting when there are no paper ballots, directly supporting military personal and other scenarios where paper ballots are not possible or desired.
