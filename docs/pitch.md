## The Pitch

VoteTracker+ is a 100% open source project that offers a verifiable guarantee directly to the voter that their ballot is correctly cast and tallied.  Via this verifiable guarantee, VoteTracker+ provides three core capabilities that increase the security, accuracy, and trustworthiness of elections:

1. Directly supplies a cryptographically anonymized ballot check back to the voter, allowing the voter to validate that their specific ballot has correctly cast and tallied - a.k.a. End-to-End Verification ([E2EV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_auditable_voting_systems))

2. Cryptographically records and seals the entire history of the election

3. Allows the public to inspect and validate the official Cast Vote Records and tally as well as potentially, via optional future extensions, the aggregate voter ID rolls across the entire electorate

See [E2EV.md](E2EV.md) for more details regarding how VTP supplies E2EV and how the live [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) based demo demonstrates that.
